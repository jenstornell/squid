# Squid

##  In short

## Setup

## Usage

### SQL Query

Write the SQL query in the textarea and press the button and it will run it and display the results below.

So far only SELECT queries are supported. No other queries can display a result.

Every time you run a query, it will also be saved to disc. If something bad happends, the query will still be saved when you refresh the page.

### Format SQL

Maybe you need a formatted SQL query with syntax highlighting. Here you can get it.

### Affected rows

A row counter of found rows.

### Table

If the SQL query is valid the data will be displayed as a table. I recommend to use `LIMIT`, else it will be slow with many rows.
